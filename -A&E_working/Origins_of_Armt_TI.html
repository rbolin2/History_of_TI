      <h3>Summary</h3>
      			
      			
      <p>Technical intelligence is intelligence about the weapons and equipment of foreign
         armies.  At the beginning of World War II, the the US Army had no technical intelligence
         organizations, procedures, or apparatus.</p>
      			
      <p>Shortly before World War II, the commanding generals of the Army Technical Services
         were instructed to set up intelligence sections in their offices. During the war,
         those sections grew into small, effect specialized technical intelligence agencies.
         After the war those organizations continued to function. </p>
      			
      <p>During the Cold War, Army technical intelligence organizations expanded dramatically
         and were reorganized radically. Eventually several Army technical intelligence activities
         were nationalized becoming key part of the Defense Intelligence Agency. </p>
      		
      
      	
      
      	
      	
      	
      	
      	
      	
      	
      	
      
      	
      	
      		
      	
      	
      	
      	
      
      						
      				
      <h3>Introduction</h3>		
      						
      <p>Technical intelligence is the branch of military intelligence that is concerned with
         the weapons and equipment of foreign armed forces.  However, intelligence is not just
         an idea. The idea must be backed with  an organization staffed with experts, as well
         as a competent technical and administrative staffs. Those organizations must collect,
         collate, and file information of interest to the organization and request that intelligence
         collections organizations gather more useful information.  The experts are available
         to answers posed by decision makers in the army and the national government.  The
         staff of the organization prepares reports on appropriate topics either by request
         or in a systematic fashion.  That bureaucracy is an intelligence organization. </p>							
      						
      <p>At the beginning of World War II, the US Armed Forces were small and weak.  They had
         inadequate personnel, weapons, equipment, and intelligence.  The intelligence section
         of the Army General staff  supported by military attaches in countries around the
         world had limited information and the Corps of Engineers had considerable expertise
         in preparing and producing maps.   However, the army had no organizations that could
         provide technical intelligence, intelligence about the production of military materiel
         and supplies in foreign countries, intelligence about beaches and coral reefs, intelligence
         about foreign ports and harbor facilities, intelligence about foreign civilian and
         military communication facilities and power grides, intelligence about foreign rail,
         road, and water transportation networks, or intelligence about medical and sanitary
         conditions aeround the world.  </p>
      					
      <p>Shortly before World War II, the Army Technical Services were instructed to set up
         intelligence offices in the offices of the commanding generals.  During World War
         II and the early Cold War, those organizations grew into vibrant, effective intelligence
         organizations providing a wide range of technical and geographical intelligence. During
         the 1940s and 1950s, one major difficulty was that seven separate organizations were
         producing that intelligence.  Coordinating the activities of numerous small organizations
         was difficult.  A major tension within the army was that the General Staff which planned
         and supervised rhe acivities of the army did not control the intelligence organizations
         they depended on.</p>
      					
      <p>In 1962, under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, the army was
         radincally reorganized and the technical and goegraphical intelligence organizations
         were consolidated.  Since then he trend has been for technical intelligence organizations
         to grow.  Several have been nationalized becoming subsidiaries of the Defense Intelligence
         Agency.</p>
                			
      					
      <p>The Chronology  below documents the evolution of Army technical intelligence from
         shortly before World War II. It is based an extensive collection of linked documents
         and records. It shows how technical ingtelligence became real with a bureaucracy to
         support it. </p> 						
      					
      <p> This is an administrative history.  It will not discuss the accomplishments of technical
         intelligence organizations.</p>           			
               
      			
      						A note on important terms.<br></br> 						
      						
      <p>Although a glossary is included below, it will be useful to clarify some terms early
         because the organization of the army changed so radically in 1962, persons familiar
         with the army from the Vietnam War era to today+++, probably would find some of the
         terms used alien. </p>
      						
      <p>A number of the documents cited make reference to the &#x201c;Supply Arms and Services.&#x201d;
         The Supply Arms and Services were bureaus that supplied the army with weapons, equipment,
         and various services.  At the beginning of World War II, The "Services of Supply"
         were: 
         						
         <ul>
            						   	
            <li>The Medical Department headed by the Surgeon General</li>
            						   	
            <li>The Chemical Warfare Service headed by the Chief of the CWS</li>
            							
            <li>The Corps of Engineers headed by the Chief of Engineers</li>
            							
            <li>The Signal Corps headed by the Chief Signal Officer</li>
            							
            <li>The Ordnance Department headed by the Chief of Ordnance</li>
            							
            <li>The Quartermaster Corps headed by the Quartermaster General</li>
            						</ul>
         						In 1942, a new technical service, the Transportation Corps headed by the Chief
         of Transportation, was created.<br></br>		
         						During World War II, the Services of Supply came to be known as the &#x201c;Technical
         Services.&#x201d;    <br></br>
         						I will use the term "Technical Services" when referring to those organizations.

      <ul>       
                						
         						
         <li>        							
            							On 6 September 1940, the <a href="#adjutant">  Adjutant General of the War Department </a>           								
            							 issued a letter entitled, &#x201c;Intelligence Sections in the <a href="#Ofice_of_the_Chief">Offices of the  Chiefs</a>of Arms and Services.&#x201d; <br></br>
            								That letter was addressed to chiefs of the Army Technical Services, as well
            as a number of other organizations. It stated that:<br></br>
            							
            								"An Intelligence Section in the Offices of Chiefs of Arms and Services will
            be established and maintained for the following purposes:     
            								
            <ul>
               										
               <li>
                  											1.  The Military Intelligence Division, War Department General Staff, receives
                  and disseminates foreign military information  of a comprehensive nature. It sends
                  out information bulletins of various kinds and maintains digests and estimates on
                  foreign countries. It recognizes that in principle, only the user knows what information
                  he wants, and only when it reaches the user is such information of any value. But
                  the Division does not always know what information is wanted by those agencies which
                  can use it, nor can it in all cases disseminate information directly to those agencies.
                  </li>
               										
               <li>
                  											2  An essential link in the intelligence chain is, therefore, a section
                  in the office of the Chicf of Arm or Service which can receive, collate and pass on
                  to M.I.D. requests for information wanted  by the using agencies of that Arm or Service,
                  and can disseminate to those agencies information which M.I.D. obtains: The needs
                  of the Arms and Services' frequently include technical questions that can be stated
                  intelligently'only by a specialist </li>
               										
               <li>
                  											3. Requests for information will be digested and collated by the intelligence
                  sections of the Arms and Services before being passed on to M.I.D. The former will
                  make sure that such requests do not cover information already received or available
                  to  them. They will also be responsible that all information received or available
                  is disseminated to all agencies of their Arm  or Service which might have use for
                  it."	</li>
               								</ul>           								
            									The rest of the letter gives instructions for handling classified information.
            
            								
            <ul>
               									
               <li>This letter was considered the charter of the technical intelligence organizations
                  within the Army Technical Services because it  instructed those organizations to assign
                  personnel to intelligenc functions, to begin collecting files and to disseminate intelligence.
                  Other responsibilities were given those intelligence sections during the war.</li>
               									
               <li>This letter was probably of most immediate impact on the Air Corps because it authorized
                  the &#x201c;Chief of Air Corps&#x201d; to set up an intelligence section. Before that, the Air Corps
                  was officially expected to rely on the Intelligence Section of the Army General Staff
                  to serve Air Corps intelligence needs.</li>

            							"The adoption of a new and improved weapon, type of ammunitiom, or artricle

            or improved  of our own means of defense or attack .Therefore, provision will be made

            of operations...The collection and study of captured materiel is an intelligfence
            function of the supply arms and services."  The remainder of the secfion states thaft
            aviation related equipment is to be given special treatment and that prisoner specialists
            should be used to help study captured materiel.<br></br>

            countries."  p. 10.	
            								The medical intelligence section in the Office of the Surgeon General was
            very active. Within a few years the army had published a series of War Department
            Technical Bulletins on the "Medical and Sanitary Data" for many countries and areas
            in the world.  Eventually, Army Medical Department officers  associated with the medical
            intelligence section in the Office of the Surgeon General coauthored a series of volumes
            called "Global epidemiology" with the subtitle "a geography of disease and sanitation"
            published commercially by William Heineman, Limited, in London.

            				  			After Pearl Harbor, officers in the Corps of Engineer began thinking about
            how the Corps an contribute to the war effort besides providing weapons, equipment,
            and combat troops and units. Based on recommendations from engineer officers, the
            Chief of Engineers ordered the Beach Erosion Board (BEB) to prepare a "Landing Area
            Report" on the Normandy Coast. That was completed in July 1942 and brought the Beach
            Erosion Board to the attention of the Chiefs of Staff. It lead to the BEB being instructed
            to begin to study potential landing beaches and to product reports on them. Before
            the end of war, that became a major effort involving cooperation with various other
            federal agencies. This is according to <a href="https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=watercenterpubs">The History of the Beach Erosion Board ... 1930-63 by Mary-Louise Quinn</a>. p. 43.

            "military reports for use in staff planning for ports and terminals facilities at

               of the service. In 1962, the technical services were disbanded. Logistics, personnel,
               and training functions were reassigned. The offices of the chiefs of some were continued
               to provide services. The Surgeon General and the Chief of Engineers are the only ones
               which survive under their old titles. The corresponding branches classifications of
               soldiers were not abolished. For example, officers continue to be commissioned in
               the Quartermaster Corps although there is no Quartermaster General. </li>

      <h3>General Orders</h3>
      					
      					
      <p> Note on Scholarly Practice:  General Orders are numbered serially in a given year.
         To identify a given order precisely, you must name the headquarters issuing the order,
         the order number, and the year.  For example, WD GO 46, 1942, clearly identifies <a href="https://history.army.mil/html/faq/branches/WD_GO_1942-38.pdf">War Department General Order 46, 1942.</a>  A General Order may address a single topic and have a title.   WD GO 46, 1942, is
         titled "Establishment of a Transportation Corps."  If a general order addresses multiple
         subjects, each subject will be contained in a seperate section numbered with Roman
         numerals.  Each section will have a title.   For example, <a href="https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/go6257.pdf">DA GO 57, 1962</a>, contains 15 sections.  Section VIII was titled, "US Army Foreign Science and Technology

         intelligence was reogranized and the Central Intelligence Agency was established,
         the National Intelligence Survey was created as a means of organizing strategic intelligence.

         communications and electrical systems, Signal Corps Technical Intelligence was assigned
         to assemble information and provide information for the NIS. The size of the staff
